NeuroHDF documentation
======================

`What if all neuroscientific datasets were stored in an HDF5 data container by a shared convention among
instrumentation manufacturers, software tool developers, and scientists?`

On the most basic level, measured and simulated data can be divided into the **sequence of recorded symbols** (usually
numbers in binary representation), and **metadata** - information about the structure of the binary data, and data
provenance such as instrumentation and simulation parameters (usually as strings). Almost all file formats basically
represent a variation on this theme, basically defining the layout of the binary data stream and a selection of
metadata attributes deemed relevant from a particular perspective or interest group.

When it comes to exchange of data, between scientists or software tools, a common practice is to use text files when
no importers/exporters/converters for the required file formats are available. For large datasets, this approach
is bound to fail and some sort of binary format that allows random access of the data is required. Furthermore,
all the metadata orginally available should be preserved.

Neuroscience has to manage and integrate data from anatomy, physiology, behavior and simulation data
on multiple spatial and temporal scales and across modalities, individuals and species. Large amounts of data are
to be produced in the coming decades - and a viable solution is to use prove approaches to deal with this data deluge.

The aim of NeuroHDF is **NOT** to create yet another file format. Its goal is to propose a convention of how to express
metadata for generic datasets, settle on a small set of metadata fields for a variety of application domains,
and provide a recommendation on how to hierarchically represent spatio-temporal datasets with an underlying geometry.

for large volumes of next generation sequencing data. And the `introduction into BioHDF <http://finchtalk.geospiza.com/2009/03/introducing-biohdf.html>`_

.. Sydney Brenner, 2002 Nobel Prize winner said (Bradford, 2003):
.. "We now have unprecedented ability to collect data about nature but there is now a crisis developing in biology, in that completely unstructured information does not enhance understanding. We need a framework to put all of this knowledge and data into — that is going to be the problem in biology. We've reached the stage where we can't talk to each other — we've all become highly specialized. We need a framework, a framework where people can come back to us and say, 'Yes, I understand.' Driving toward that framework is really the big challenge."
