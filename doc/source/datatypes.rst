.. _datatypes:

Variety of neuroscience dataset types
-------------------------------------

Anatomy
^^^^^^^

* Dense reconstruction of neuropile from electron microscopy

  * Regular 3D grid segmenting the structures in a spatial reference system
  * Sets of area lists representing structures
  * Sets of surface meshes representing structures

* Network of brain regions and their connectivity

* Network of neurons and their connectivity (circuit diagram)

* Network of neuron classes and their connection probability (circuit diagram)


Development
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Cell lineages: Cell division, differentiation and migration data in 3D

Genomics/Proteomics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Gene expression array of genes assayed in a spatial volume
  for a particular genotypic state, physiological state, developmental stage,
  after perturbation with different set of parameters

* Tractography dataset
  - Irregular 3D data in spatial reference system
