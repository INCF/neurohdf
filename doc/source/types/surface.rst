Surfaces
========

A proliferation of file formats exist for 3D surfaces. The most widely used
scheme to store surfaces is as triangular meshes, using vertices (points in 3D)
and faces (usually triangles which describe the connectivity of the vertices).
Additionally, values can be stored either on the vertices or faces. We propose
the same convention to store surfaces in NeuroHDF. Additionally, level-of-detail
meshes can be expressed with an additional group indirection.
