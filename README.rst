Neuroscientists need to manage and integrate data from anatomy, physiology, behavior and simulation data
on multiple spatial and temporal scales and across modalities, individuals and species. Large amounts of data with
complex data types are to be produced in the coming decades - and viable solutions for databasing, data sharing and
interoperability of software tools `are needed <http://incf.org/programs>`_.
